# WeightedLinearregression
Linear Regression and Weighted Linear Regression using Matrix Multiplication  

This project is aimed at performing Linear Regression and Weighted Linear regression implemented in C++.

The "data.h" file splits the dataset for training and testing purposes.
The "Regression.h" file performs the actual regression.

Eigen is a C++ library of template headers used for linear algebra and matrix and vector operations. Think, in some sense, the Numpy for C++.

This implemention is based on the resource.

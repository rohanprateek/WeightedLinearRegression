# WeightedLinearregression
Linear Regression and Weighted Linear Regression using Matrix Multiplication  

This project is aimed at performing Linear Regression and Weighted Linear regression implemented in C++.

The "data.h" file splits the dataset for training and testing purposes.
The "Regression.h" file performs the actual regression.

[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) is a C++ library of template headers used for linear algebra and matrix and vector operations. Think, in some sense, the Numpy for C++. Here is the [documentation](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/).

This implemention is based on the following [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/weighted-linear-regression-2ef23b12a6d7).
